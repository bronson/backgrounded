- Make it interactive!
  - no need to quote command
  - runs the command, then shows you a tail -f of the logfile
  - control-c disconnects (obviously), re-running will reattach

something like this:

backgrounded  -> "no process running"
backgrounded sleep 20 -> (hangs, but runs tail -f on logfile)
control-c     -> 'detached, sleep 20 running in the background'
backgrounded  -> 'reattached to sleep 20' (runs tail -f on logfile)
control-c     -> 'detached, sleep 20 running in the background'
backgrounded --kill -> 'killed sleep 20'
